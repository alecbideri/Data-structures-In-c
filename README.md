# Linked lists project

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in C and C++. Each data structure is implemented in its own file.

## C Files
- `Singly linked list using c/`: This directory contains implementations of a singly linked list data structure in C.
  - `Insert_Node_head.c`: Implementation of inserting a node at the head of the singly linked list.
  - `Insert_Node_tail.c`: Implementation of inserting a node at the tail of the singly linked list.
  - `Delete_node.c`: Implementation of deleting a node from the singly linked list.
  - `ai_comparison.c`: Implementation of various operations on the singly linked list with an AI comparison.
  - `practice.c`: Practice file for experimenting with the singly linked list.

- `doubly linked list c/`: This directory contains implementations of a doubly linked list data structure in C.
  - `insert_tail.c`: Implementation of inserting a node at the tail of the doubly linked list.
  - `demo.c`: Demonstration file for the doubly linked list.
  - `practice.c`: Practice file for experimenting with the doubly linked list.

## C++ Files
- `Singly linked list using c++/`: This directory contains implementations of a singly linked list data structure in C++.
  - `delete_node.c++`: Implementation of deleting a node from the singly linked list.
  - `insert_Node_tail.c++`: Implementation of inserting a node at the tail of the singly linked list.
  - `insert_node_head.c++`: Implementation of inserting a node at the head of the singly linked list.
  - `singly_whole.c++`: Implementation of various operations on the singly linked list.
  
- `Doubly linked list c++/`: This directory contains implementations of a doubly linked list data structure in C++.
  - `insert_tail.c++`: Implementation of inserting a node at the tail of the doubly linked list.
  - `whole.c++`: Implementation of various operations on the doubly linked list.

Feel free to explore the implementations and use them in your projects. Contributions and improvements are welcome!
